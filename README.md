# Hello, welcome to [Genre Graph](https://genresgraph.netlify.app/)
(name pending)
this marks the start of the pre alpha

I got questioned something in a programmers chat-group that i didnt expect, "whats the purpose of this project" so, i will elaborate, i have had this hobby of music for a long time, some people call it "melomaniac" i call this just being a high music obsessed dork, i love my beep boops. I used to participate on /mu/, on /mu/ facebook groups and even on telegram and discord, and have met incredible people and gave me courage to start a blog, and now, back to track; What is this? Having a hobby and digging deep into it you find gems the more you dig (thats why it is called digging duh, because is a minecraft reference) you fall in love with the first thing that welcomed you to this world but also with those obscure things you find along the way, making more sweet the way, the road, but there was no way to know the relationships between artists, songs, how x artist came with the idea of mixing two different genres and creating such masterpiece, but thats a harder task than you think, excavating down into those inspirations, but also, how is a genre created, how did dubstep come from reggae? the relationships of industrial and its influence, is there a difference between european and american classical music? i wanna answer those questions, expand on the info, give recomendations, and overall, overwhelm the viewer with all those lines and points on the canvas and show the complexity of an ever growing art as music is.

# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
